    question: "What does NexFlow do?",
    answer:
      "NexFlow turns your wearable health data into personalized experiments. You connect your Apple Watch or other wearable, choose a habit to test (like adjusting caffeine timing or sleep schedule), and run a 14-day experiment. NexFlow analyzes your sleep, energy, and focus data to show you exactly what changed. You get proof, not guesses.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from my health app?",
    answer:
      "Most health apps track your data passively without helping you understand cause and effect. NexFlow is built for wearable health experiments. You change one variable, and we isolate its impact on your sleep, energy, and focus. Instead of endless dashboards, you get clear before-and-after comparisons that tell you what actually works for your body.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a smartwatch?",
    answer:
      "A wearable like an Apple Watch, Garmin, or Oura Ring gives you the richest data for experiments. However, NexFlow also works with Apple Health data from your phone or simple manual logging. The more consistent data you have, the clearer your experiment results will be.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is NexFlow for?",
    answer:
      "NexFlow is designed for high-performing knowledge workers who already wear a smartwatch and want data-backed answers instead of generic wellness advice. If you've ever wondered whether that supplement, sleep hack, or morning routine actually helps your energy and focus, NexFlow gives you the proof.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a free version or free trial?",
    answer:
      "NexFlow is a paid product with no free tier. This keeps the product focused on serious users who want real results from their wearable health experiments. It also ensures we never rely on ads or selling your data. Founding members lock in lifetime pricing.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do I get when I sign up?",
    answer:
      "You can connect your wearable data, set up personalized 14-day health experiments, see clear before-and-after comparisons of your sleep, energy, and focus, and chat with an AI health assistant about your patterns. Everything is designed to help you learn what works for your unique body.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long until I see results?",
    answer:
      "Most users see meaningful insights by the end of their first 14-day experiment. The app establishes your baseline during the first few days, then tracks changes throughout your experiment. By day 14, you'll have clear data on how that habit affected your sleep quality, energy levels, or focus.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this medical advice?",
    answer:
      "No. NexFlow is for lifestyle and habit experiments only. It does not diagnose, treat, or provide medical advice. Think of it as a personal lab for testing routines. For any health concerns or medical decisions, always consult with your doctor.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data private?",
    answer:
      "Yes, your data privacy is a core principle. All wearable health data is encrypted, never sold to third parties, and never used for advertising. You can delete your account and all associated data at any time. We believe your health data belongs to you.",
  },
  {
    question: "What can I test with NexFlow?",
    answer:
      "You can run experiments on caffeine timing, sleep schedules, step counts, exercise routines, screen time limits, cold showers, meditation, alcohol-free windows, supplement timing, and dozens of other daily habits. If you can track it and change it, you can test whether it actually affects your sleep, energy, or focus.",
