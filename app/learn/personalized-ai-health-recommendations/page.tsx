              "Drink 8 glasses of water." "Get 8 hours of sleep." "Exercise 30 minutes daily." Generic health advice treats everyone the same. But your body is unique, and AI can finally account for that.

              The Problem with Averages
            </h2>
            <p className="text-[#6B6B6B] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Most health recommendations come from population studies. They tell you what works for the average person. But you're not average, and no one is. Your genetics, lifestyle, environment, and history create a unique profile that generic advice can't address.
            </p>

              Individual Response Variation
            </h2>
            <p className="text-[#6B6B6B] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Research shows enormous variation in how individuals respond to the same interventions. Some people thrive on morning exercise; others perform better in the evening. Some tolerate caffeine well; others are highly sensitive. These differences are measurable with the right data.

              How AI Learns Your Patterns
            </h2>
            <p className="text-[#6B6B6B] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              AI can process your wearable data, habits, and outcomes to identify what actually works for you. Instead of generic rules, you get recommendations based on your demonstrated responses. The algorithm improves as it gathers more of your data.

              From Data to Action
            </h2>
            <p className="text-[#6B6B6B] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Personalized AI doesn't just observe. It suggests experiments tailored to your patterns. When the data shows a correlation, it proposes testing causation. This scientific approach, applied to your individual body, is the future of preventive health.
