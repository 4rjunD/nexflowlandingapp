              The post-lunch energy dip is one of the most common productivity killers. But it's not random. Your body follows predictable patterns, and understanding them through data can help you work with your biology instead of against it.

              The Circadian Dip
            </h2>
            <p className="text-[#6B6B6B] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Between 1pm and 3pm, your body experiences a natural dip in alertness. This is hardwired into your circadian rhythm and happens regardless of whether you ate lunch. The dip is more pronounced if you're carrying sleep debt.
            </p>

              className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#111111] mt-10 mb-4"

              Blood Sugar and Meal Composition
            </h2>
            <p className="text-[#6B6B6B] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              High-carbohydrate lunches can amplify the afternoon crash. Your body diverts blood to digestion and releases insulin, which can trigger drowsiness. Tracking what you eat alongside your energy patterns reveals your personal triggers.
            </p>

            <h2
              className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#111111] mt-10 mb-4"

              Using Data to Find Your Solution
            </h2>
            <p className="text-[#6B6B6B] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Run a two-week experiment: try different lunch compositions and timings while tracking your afternoon energy. Some people do better with smaller meals, others with more protein. Your wearable data can show the correlation.
            </p>

            <h2
              className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#111111] mt-10 mb-4"

              Strategic Interventions
            </h2>
            <p className="text-[#6B6B6B] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              If you know the crash is coming, schedule low-cognitive tasks for that window. A 10-minute walk can reset your alertness. Some find strategic caffeine timing helps, but timing matters. Too late and you'll impact tonight's sleep.
