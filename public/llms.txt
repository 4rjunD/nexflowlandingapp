# NexFlow

> NexFlow is a personalized health experiments app that helps users discover what habits actually work for their body.

## What NexFlow Does

NexFlow lets you run simple 14-day experiments on your daily habits to see what actually improves your sleep, energy, and focus. Instead of guessing whether that supplement works or if cutting caffeine helps your sleep, you get real before-and-after data.

### Core Features
- Run 14-day experiments on habits (caffeine timing, sleep schedules, supplements, morning routines, etc.)
- Track sleep quality, energy levels, and focus throughout the day
- Get clear before-and-after comparisons showing exactly what changed
- AI assistant that explains your patterns in plain English
- Works with or without a wearable device

### Supported Devices
- Apple Watch
- Oura Ring
- Garmin
- Any device that syncs with Apple Health
- Manual check-ins (no wearable required)

- Already wear a smartwatch or health tracker

- NOT a passive health tracking app with endless dashboards
- NOT selling or sharing your health data
